# DSML_Internship_Supply_chain_Management

This project is all about, developing a Machine Learning model to predict the supply quantity in each and every warehouse in the entire country.

**GOALS**
The objective of this exercise is to build a model, using historical data that will determine an
optimum weight of the product to be shipped each time from the respective warehouse.
1. Focus on all steps of data science (EDA, data processing, model, evaluation, charts)
2. Highlight any trend in data, deep insight, novel steps that you take
3. Highlight next steps and improvements.
4. Apply 5 to 6 machine learning algorithms and evaluate it using Test dataset .
